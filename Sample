Creating a Root CA certificate (DF-2-1_RootCA.pem) involves generating a private key and a self-signed certificate. Here are the steps to create one using OpenSSL:

Steps to Create a Root CA Certificate

1. Install OpenSSL

Ensure that OpenSSL is installed on your system:
	•	Mac: OpenSSL is pre-installed. Update it using Homebrew if necessary:

brew install openssl


	•	iOS/iPadOS: Use a Mac to generate the certificate, as these platforms don’t support OpenSSL natively.

2. Generate a Private Key

Run the following command to generate a private key for the Root CA:

openssl genrsa -out DF-2-1_RootCA.key 4096

	•	This creates a 4096-bit RSA private key file named DF-2-1_RootCA.key.

3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

A CSR is not required for self-signed certificates, but you can create one for consistency:

openssl req -new -key DF-2-1_RootCA.key -out DF-2-1_RootCA.csr

	•	You’ll be prompted to enter information such as:
	•	Country Name (e.g., US)
	•	State or Province Name
	•	Locality Name (City)
	•	Organization Name
	•	Organizational Unit Name
	•	Common Name (e.g., DF-2-1 Root CA)
	•	Email Address
	•	Leave fields empty if not applicable.

4. Generate the Root CA Certificate

Create a self-signed certificate using the private key:

openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in DF-2-1_RootCA.csr -signkey DF-2-1_RootCA.key -out DF-2-1_RootCA.pem

	•	-days 3650: Specifies the certificate validity period (10 years).
	•	-signkey: Indicates that this certificate is self-signed.
	•	DF-2-1_RootCA.pem: The output certificate in PEM format.

5. Verify the Certificate

To check the details of the generated certificate:

openssl x509 -in DF-2-1_RootCA.pem -text -noout

Generated Files

	1.	DF-2-1_RootCA.key - Private key.
	2.	DF-2-1_RootCA.pem - Root CA certificate.

6. (Optional) Set up a Certificate Authority Directory

If you plan to use the Root CA for issuing subordinate certificates:
	•	Create a directory for your CA:

mkdir -p /etc/df-2-1-ca
cp DF-2-1_RootCA.pem DF-2-1_RootCA.key /etc/df-2-1-ca/


	•	Maintain a database of issued certificates and revocation lists.

To create a root CA certificate (DF-2-1_RootCA.pem) and its private key, you can use OpenSSL. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. Generate a Private Key

Run the following command to generate a 2048-bit private key. You can adjust the key size if needed (e.g., 4096).

openssl genrsa -out DF-2-1_RootCA.key 2048

2. Create a Root CA Certificate

Use the private key to create a self-signed certificate for your root CA. Customize the subject fields as needed.

openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key DF-2-1_RootCA.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out DF-2-1_RootCA.pem

Explanation:

	•	-x509: Indicates a self-signed certificate.
	•	-nodes: Prevents encryption of the private key (no passphrase required).
	•	-key: Specifies the private key to use.
	•	-sha256: Specifies the hashing algorithm (recommended).
	•	-days 3650: Sets the certificate validity period to 10 years.
	•	-out: Specifies the output certificate file.

3. Verify the Files

To ensure the files were created correctly:
	•	Check the private key:

openssl rsa -in DF-2-1_RootCA.key -check
